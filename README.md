## Requirements

To use adLDAP, your sever must support:

- PHP 5.4 or greater
- PHP LDAP Extension


## Optional Requirements

If your AD server requires SSL, your server must support the following libraries:

- PHP SSL Libraries (http://php.net/openssl)

## Installation

adLDAP has moved to a composer based installation. If you'd like to use adLDAP without an auto-loader, you'll
have to require the files inside the project `src/` directory yourself.

Insert Adldap into your `composer.json` file:

    "adldap/adldap": "5.0.*"
   
Run `composer update`

You're good to go!

## Need to test an LDAP connection?

If you need to test something with access to an LDAP server, the generous folks at [Georgia Tech](http://drupal.gatech.edu/handbook/public-ldap-server) have you covered.

Use the following configuration:

    $config = array(
        'account_suffix' => "@gatech.edu",
    
        'domain_controllers' => array("whitepages.gatech.edu"),
    
        'base_dn' => 'dc=whitepages,dc=gatech,dc=edu',
    
        'admin_username' => '',
    
        'admin_password' => '',
    );
    
    $ad = new Adldap($config);
    
However while useful for basic testing, the queryable data only includes user data, so if you're looking for testing with any other information
or functionality such as modification, you'll have to use you're own server.
